*"There comes a point in every man's life where he wishes for one thing. To become the strongest in the world." - Aphaphel Saaf*

Aphaphel Saaf, otherwise known as The Saint of Swords, is an elf saint travelling the world in search of fights. His exact age is unknown, but he is suspected to be the only surviving person of [[History/Pre Destruction/The First Age]] after being given an immunity to aging as a blessing from [[Kedvar]]. It is also likely that his place of birth was destroyed during [[The Harbinger Solstice]], making it hard to discern his true origins.

Despite being given the title of Saint, Aphaphel is the only person to have ever recieved this title without acting on behalf of any god. His title comes from his near perfected form and ability in swordsmanship, being compared to the gods in pure skill alone. He had reached his peak during [[History/Pre Destruction/The First Age]], challenging the greatest fighters the world had to offer. Centuries later during the beginning of the [[The Second Age]] he sought to reclaim his title as the worlds strongest after the world changed forever.
