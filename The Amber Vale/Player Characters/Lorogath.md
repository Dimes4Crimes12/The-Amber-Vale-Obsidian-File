Lorogath is a golliath barbarian born in a small village north of Midgulch. His natural born strength and will to help those he's close to lead him to a life of mercenary group.

***Early Years***
Lorogath grew up in a tiny village north of Midgulch, with only a population of ~100. This small community meant that everyone knew everyone very closely, and worked together to support eachother. Lorogath grew up with this sense of community from birth, working on a farmstead with animals dusk till dawn.

This constant hard work built Lorogath's body to respectable heights, a developed muscular build even at a young age. Despite this quiet life, much of it was not fufilling for Lorogath. He saw how his village struggled at times and how much he wished to help.

He realised the answer to this did not lie within his village, and instead he left in his early adult years to take up mercenary work. Battling monsters across the coast, Lorogath's innate strength took well to combat and he knew he found his calling. Even so, his pitiful money making was nowhere near enough to support his village as he wanted.

Then his attention came to the dragon, a gamble for his life which if he won, would set him and his loved ones for life. Determined, confident and ready, he headed for Phandalin in search of clues of the dragons resting place where he would go on to join the party.

***Personality***
Lorogath is a hard read for some. His large exterior may imply a sense of foolishness, but Lorogath always acts as he intends even if he wasn't given the best education. Not knowing what life was like in the world outside his village, he is careful to reveal his motivations too fast and act too quick.

This is not to say that he is perfectly methodical, as he is often the first to charge into combat head on. Compared to his comrades, Lorogath possesses inhuman strength which he levies to his advantage with brutal strikes from his greataxe and javelins. Even when he is beset by enemy attacks, his rage lets him stay concious and roaring to fight even after shredded by convential weapons.
