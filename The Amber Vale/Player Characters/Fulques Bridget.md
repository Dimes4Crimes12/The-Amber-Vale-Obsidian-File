Fulques Bridget is a human monk born in Cethalon and is a member of the Cethalon monestary. His efficacy with martial arts and inherent sense of justice lead him to adventuring with the party to hunt the dragon terrorising the Clay Coast.

***Early Years*** 
Despite his young age, his training extends all the way back into early childhood. Unfortunate circumstances lead him to a homeless life on the streets of Cethalon while he was only a child, receiving care from the monestary. 
His life took a turn when he was offered an official place in the monestary as a monk in training by a teacher there, Usher Godfrey. This offer was made on the condition that once his training was complete he was to leave Cethalon to help others around the world, paying the kindess forward.

Fulques accepted this offer, and soon began training under Usher's directions. Though he was tough on Fulques, he was just as quick to support him when he needed it. Fulques excelled in physical training, quickly surpassing others his age and even some seniors of the monestary. His ability in historical and philisophical studies was less impressive though, being rather forgetful and prefering the freedom that martial arts offered him. 

9 years later Fulques had officially passed his training at the age of 18 and, honoring his agreement, left Cethalon in hopes of making the world a better place, a sense of morality that Usher had instilled within him. Before he left, Usher gifted him with a ring as a good luck charm.

Exploring the coast and some of Telwyn over the next year, Fulques saw the poor conditions many were forced to live in. After entering a town recently besieged by the dragon, Fulques knew immediately what his objective was to be. After asking around, he heard rumors of it frequently attacking settlements on the Clay Coast. Further searches lead him to Phandalin, where his history with the party begins.


*__Personality__*
Fulques is an upbeat and optimistic man, taking most of his qualities from Usher. He's quicker to help those in need than some of his comrades and will often act friendly to most they come across.

Inspite of this seemingly soft personality, Fulques possesses a nigh inhuman level of dexterity and wit. His years of training in martial arts had honed his mind and body, capable of devastating unarmed strikes at a lightning speed. His knowledge of weak points within the human body allow him to harness and exploit the flow of [[Ki]], paralyzing his foes and straining his body to accomplish incredible feats. His intuition and keen senses also gives him a good idea if someone is telling the truth, capable of reading the actions of those who oppose him.

All these qualities lead to a close bond with his party members. Fulques is seemingly closest with [[Lorogath]], sharing a close bond and having saved eachothers lives countless times. [[Polaris]], on the other hand, is much of a antithesis of Fulques' beliefs which may lead him to act rebelliously or out of character. [[Matthew Squillesworth]] is a balance of the other two. While Fulques appreciates his noble and kind initiative, Matthew is often slower in action and more methodical which they are in slight disagreement in.
