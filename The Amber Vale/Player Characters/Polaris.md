Polaris is an elven ranger born in Seabreeze. His terrible childhood and closeness with Kiln lead him to join the party in efforts of hunting the dragon terrorising the Clay Coast.


***Early Years***
Polaris grew up on the streets of Seabreeze, abandoned by everyone but his father. This was not a bond of compassion, as his father would regularly berate and beat him for the smallest things. This taught Polaris from a young age to fight for himself, and the only person to rely on should be yourself.

In his teenage years Polaris was mostly a street thug, taking what he needed when he needed it. One day he came across Kiln, a respected bounty hunter, and Polaris quickly followed in his footsteps. Kiln ended up teaching Polaris the fundementals of fighting and hunting, finally giving his pent up rage a place to be exerted. 

A couple years after, Polaris' attention came to the bounty of the dragon. Thousands of gold was placed on its head and would give him wealth and fame beyond anything he could have hoped for. Settting out by himself for the first time, Polaris made his way to Phandalin searching for clues of the dragons location, where he would then go on to join the party.


***Personality***
Polaris has seen the worst the world has to offer, and he is much reflective of that. Chaotic, impulsive and reckless, Polaris is quick to act in his own favour and rarely acts out of kindness. His trust has extended to Kiln and the party, but beyond that he is cautious of everyone he comes across.

His formative years have also honed his fighting ability, with Kiln training him to an expert level of guerilla warfare. His archery skills are lethal and fast, capable of slamming a target from hundreds of feet while on the move. His basic perceptions and understandings of [[The Pattern]] offer him a magical arsenal to further propel his fighting ability, capable of cursing and hunting the foes he wishes.
