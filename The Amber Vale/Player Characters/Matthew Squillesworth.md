Matthew is a human cleric born in Cethalon and is a member of Cethalon's temple in worship to [[Kedvar, The Lifesource]]. His unfortunate childhood and resolve lead him to joining the party in hunt of the dragon haunting the Clay Coast.

***Early Years***
Matthew grew up in a poor family on the outskirts of Cethalon, where comfort was hard to come by. Despite facing the hardships of this lifestyle, Matthew was happy. On Matthew's fifth birthday, his father left him and his mother behind in hopes of the glory of slaying the dragon. Matthew's hatred for his father sparked, questioning why he had left. Matthew then grew up having to care for himself and his mother, unable to gain the freedom a child should have.

15 years later, his mother fell ill with an unknown disease. She fell ill very quickly and was soon unable to help herself. In desperation to help his only remaining family, Matthew pleged himself to the Cethalon temple, devoting his life and studies to Kedvar in hopes of one day gaining enough power to heal his mother.

3 long years passed, and a 21 year old Matthew completed his studies and rushed home to heal his mother. It was all to late though, as she had succumbed to her illness an unknown time before.

Devestated, Matthew fell into a silent anger, boiled by years of neglect and hardship. Blaming his father for leaving, and in turn the dragon for causing his father to leave, Matthew made a new pledge to rid the Clay Coast of the dragon tyrant.

First though he needed a journey of healing, travelling to Phandalin in time for the autumn festival, the home town of his mother. The events unfolding in Phandalin lead Matthew to join the party in efforts to hunt the dragon.


***Personality***
Matthew is a man who has been bullied and punished by life, and still comes out the other end smiling. His devotion to Kedvar has taught him compassion in place of malice and strategy in place of recklessness. He often feels calm when close with nature and will act in self defence when necessary.

Even with such a forgiving outlook, Matthew can be quick to anger when touchy subjects are bought up and unleashes anger pent up over decades.

Matthew's studies in the Cethalon temple have granted him a basic understanding of [[The Pattern]], capable of summoning torrents of magical effects to support his allies and decimate his enemies. His speciality in healing has allowed him to save the lives of many, and even bring his party members back from the brink of death.
